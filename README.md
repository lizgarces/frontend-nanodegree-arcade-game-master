## Documentation
___
This project was designed by Udacity so the developer will practice using Object-Oriented JavaScript. Udacity made a repository with css files, images, js files and a HTML file. The developer was responsible to implement the functionality of the characters provided.
The player will try to reach the water and the enemies, in this case, the bugs, will move in their own line and will try to touch her and make her start all over again.
To move the player, you must use the following keys in your computer's keyboard:
- Up key, the player will move up
- Down key, the player will move down
- Left key, the player will move left
- Right key, the player will move right

When the player reaches the water, all of the enemies, will stop and die.
You will see some gems in the board. You can move the player to try and get them. When the player touches a gem, the gem will turn into a shiny star.
The gems and the bugs don't interact with each other.
